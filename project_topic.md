***ACADEMIC PROJECT FOR FOR DATABASE SUBJECT***

The systematic increase in the number of participants attending scientific conferences has prompted the initiation of a project to develop a computer system that will streamline conference management.

Lists of conference participants and their presentations, stored in the system, are prepared prior to the event’s start. No subsequent modifications are anticipated. Each presentation has at least one author, and at least one of these authors must be a conference participant (there may also be participants who are not authors of any presentation). For authors and participants, the system stores their personal data (first name, last name, title, and the name of the university/research institution). Each participant pays a conference fee (this fee can assume one of several predetermined values and does not depend on the number of presentations given by that participant).

Basic information concerning each presentation includes: title, author(s), keywords, abstract, and thematic categories. Presentations are divided into three types: articles, lectures (so-called tutorials), and posters. The duration of presentations is important: all articles are assigned the same presentation time, while the length of each lecture is determined individually. Posters are also assigned a uniform presentation time. The system records which participant delivers the presentation. Lectures may be delivered multiple times during the conference, while other presentations occur only once. A participant delivering a lecture is not required to pay any conference fee. For articles, the system additionally stores the number of pages and whether the article has been submitted.

A conference usually lasts several days (the system must record these dates), and each day comprises multiple sessions. Sessions may take place in parallel. A session can feature at most one lecture and one article; all other presentations in that session must be posters. Posters are presented in special poster sessions. After a session concludes, information about its chairperson (the “chairman”—one of the participants, who may not present anything in that session) is recorded. Each session has a planned time frame (start and end times). The system must ensure that no session is assigned an overly large program of presentations. The order of presentations is set before the session starts and does not change afterward. The system must also record the actual order of delivery and note any presentations that did not take place (e.g., due to the absence of the scheduled presenter).

The conference takes place in rooms (each with a unique number). Some rooms are available to the conference only during a certain portion of the day. The system must prevent assigning the same room to two concurrently running sessions. Presentations are also closely tied to conference equipment (projectors, laptops, etc.). Similarly to rooms, the system must not assign the same piece of equipment to concurrently running sessions. Some equipment is permanently installed in certain rooms, while other equipment may be moved between them.

The system should provide a summary of participants who have not paid their required conference fee and those who have not delivered their articles.

For each conference day, it should be possible to obtain a list of planned presentations as well as those that did not occur. Presentations are (manually or automatically by the system) allocated to sessions that will take place and where sufficient equipment resources are available.

The system should also make it possible to determine which room will be available on a given day at a specific time, and when a particular room or piece of equipment will be free.
